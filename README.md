# TaskbarXI-Rust

An application written in Rust to modify the Windows 11 Taskbar.

## TODO

Currently under development

## Contributing

- Ensure git hooks are configured:  
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`  
  For now git hooks will be utilized in favor of CI/CD due to reliance on Windows API's, window manager etc. that aren't available in a clean-room environment such as a Github Actions runner.
